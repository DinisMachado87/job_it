## Introduction

The BakeBakery App is a Python terminal-based application designed to help users manage recipes, pantry goals, and shopping lists for a bakery. It allows users to interact with recipes, update pantry goals based on recipes, get shopping lists, register shopped groceries, and more.

## Features

### Recipe Management

View recipes for various baked goods, including croissants, pastel de nata, Portuguese rice flour cakes, and brownies.
Print detailed ingredient lists for each recipe.

### Pantry Goals

Update pantry goals automatically when updating the intended servings of a recipe. The app automatically adds ingredients from all recipes and a 20% safety increase to each ingredient on pantry goals.

## How to Use

Click the link to [Bakery Bake](https://bakery-bake-83c76bb3649a.herokuapp.com/) or past 'https://bakery-bake-83c76bb3649a.herokuapp.com/' in your browser.
Navigate through the menu using arrow keys and Enter.
Choose actions such as getting a shopping list, updating recipe doses, registering shopped groceries, or registering cooked recipes.
Follow on-screen prompts to input necessary information.

## Technologies

### Languages:

Python 3.8.5: Used to write the whole app


### Dependencies

Heroku: used as a terminal to deploy the app.
Google Sheets API library for accessing and modifying Google Sheets.
google-auth: Google Authentication library.
simple-term-menu: Library for creating terminal-based menus.

### Standard library imports:

[os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html ) was used to clear the terminal before running the program.

### Other tools:

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) was used as the main tool to write and edit code.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) was used to host the code of the website.

## Resolved bugs

Through testing, we realized we needed to create a validation function to make sure the data introduced by the user is a non-negative numeric value, whether it's an integer or a float. This function, named verify_input, not only checks for the correctness of the input type but also ensures that the input is not an empty string, rejecting negative numbers. The get_valid_input function encapsulates the user input process, prompting the user until a valid input is provided, thus enhancing the robustness and reliability of our data processing.

## Deployment

### Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/BakeBakery.git

### Install the required dependencies: 

pip install gspread google-auth simple-term-menu

### Set up Google Sheets API:

* Follow the instructions in the gspread documentation to create and download a service account key in JSON format.
* Place the downloaded JSON key file in the project directory and name it creds.json.
* Create a Google Sheets document and name it 'BakeryBake'. Share it with the email address provided in the client_email field of the creds.json file.

### Configure Heroku GitHub Integration:

* Navigate to the Deploy tab of your Heroku app in the Heroku Dashboard.
* Enable GitHub integration by authenticating with GitHub.
* Ensure that your GitHub repository has admin access, as this is required for configuring automatic GitHub deploys.
* Link your Heroku app to a GitHub repo in the Deploy tab.
* Optionally, configure manual or automatic deploys based on your preferences.

### Run the application on Heroku:

* After setting up GitHub integration, you can deploy your app manually by selecting the desired branch and clicking "Deploy Branch."
* For automatic deploys, any pushes to the specified GitHub branch will trigger Heroku to build and deploy the changes.

### Additional Notes:

* View build output and historical build information in the applicationâ€™s Activity tab on the Heroku Dashboard.
* Ensure that the GitHub repository is accessible and the GitHub integration has the necessary permissions for smooth deployment.
* For troubleshooting or additional information, refer to the Heroku GitHub Integration FAQ.
