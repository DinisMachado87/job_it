## Functionality

### Dream Job Matching Functionality

I've implemented a dream job matching functionality using a function inside the job Model. The goal of this function is to match job applications with the userâ€™s dream job criteria and rank them based on how closely they align.

#### Functionality Overview

- **Job Model**: I defined a Django model named `Job` to represent job applications. This model includes various fields such as commute time, office days, responsibility level, etc., each with corresponding choices defined.
  
- **Dream Job Reference**: I added a boolean field `is_dream_job` to indicate whether a particular job application is the user dream job. This reference job serves as the baseline for comparing other job applications.

- **Match Percentage Calculation**: I implemented a method `calculate_match_percentage()` within the `Job` model. This method calculates the match percentage between a job application and the users dream job. It compares each field of the job application with the corresponding field of the dream job, calculates the percentage difference, and then averages these percentages to determine the overall match percentage.

- **Sorting Jobs**: I implemented a Django Meta class to specify the ordering of job applications based on their match percentage. Jobs with higher match percentages are ranked higher in the list, showing the user the most matching overall job applications to prioritise.

## Resolved bugs

### Debugging the Database

When originally attempting to run migrations or start the Django server, the following error occured:

    '''
    > [!Error]
    django.core.exceptions.AppRegistryNotReady: Models aren't loaded yet.
    '''

During the process of debugging the database-related issues, several solutions were attempted to address the "Models aren't loaded yet" error. Each solution aimed to ensure that database queries were performed at the appropriate time and that Django models were fully initialized before accessing them.


1. **Moving Database Queries into Callable Methods**:
Initially, I tried moving database queries into functions within the models.py file. For example, instead of directly assigning choices to fields, I defined methods to retrieve choices when needed. However, this approach didn't fully solve the problem because Django models weren't fully ready when the models.py file was loaded.

    ```
    class Location(models.Model):
       @staticmethod
       def get_choices():
           return Location.objects.values_list('id', 'choice')
    ```

2. **Reusable get_choices Function**:
   Another attempt was to create a reusable function to get choices for any model class. This function aimed to centralize the logic for retrieving choices. However, it faced the same issue as before because Django models weren't fully initialized at the time of import.

   ```
   def get_choices(model_class):
       return model_class.objects.values_list('id', 'choice')
   ```

3. **Using a Callable Class**:
   To overcome the issue with directly querying the database in functions called at import time, I tried using a callable class. This class, named ChoiceGetter, was instantiated by Django when it was ready to get the choices. However, it caused a new problem where Django expected choices to be an iterable, but it received a callable instead.

   ```
   class ChoiceGetter:
       def __call__(self, model_class):
           return model_class.objects.values_list('id', 'choice')
   ```

4. **Modifying the ChoiceGetter Class**:
   To fix the issue with Django expecting choices to be an iterable, I modified the ChoiceGetter class to return choices as a list or tuple when called. This ensured that the choices were in the correct format for Django's expectations.

   ```
   class ChoiceGetter:
       def __call__(self, model_class):
           choices = model_class.objects.values_list('id', 'choice')
           return list(choices)
   ```

5. **Moving Logic to View or Form**:
   Finally, I realized that forms are processed after all models are loaded in Django. So, I moved the logic of setting choices to the form. This ensured that models were fully loaded before attempting to access them, avoiding issues with models not being ready at the time of import.

   ```
   class JobForm(forms.ModelForm):
       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
           self.fields['schedule_type'].choices = get_choices(ScheduleType)
           # Other fields' choices set similarly...
   ``` 

By experimenting with these different approaches and considering the timing of model initialization, eventually the issues were resolved, leading to a stable and functional database implementation.


### Reflection on Project Scope and Agile Development

After two days of struggling with an error loop, I came to the realization that I needed to further reduce the scope of the project. Initially, my `models.py` file was extensive, aiming to cover a wide range of functionalities and options. However, this ambitious approach led to complexities and difficulties in implementation.

The overwhelming moments during this process made me understand the importance and relevance of agile functionality in software development. Agile methodology emphasizes incremental and iterative development, allowing for adjustments and adaptations along the way. 

In response to the challenges faced, I decided to streamline the project and implement functionality progressively. This shift in approach enabled me to focus on the core features and build them out more efficiently. It also helped in maintaining my mental health and avoiding burnout by breaking down the workload into manageable tasks.

The `models.py` code was refactored to prioritize essential functionalities, focusing on the job matching aspect. By doing so, I was able to create a more robust and manageable codebase, ensuring better maintainability and scalability in the long run.

Moving forward, I intend to continue embracing agile principles in my development process, recognizing their role in contributing to the successful and efficient development of applications. This experience has reinforced the importance of adaptability and flexibility in tackling software development challenges.


### Debugging Views.py

In the process of fixing issues in `views.py`, I took a step-by-step approach to solve problems that emerged after going back to an earlier version of our code. I reintroduced and rearranged views one at a time to uncover and fix underlying issues, making sure their logic made sense.

This method allowed me to thoroughly examine how views interact with the `Job` object in our Django app. I faced challenges with views relying too much on each other, causing unexpected problems. Additionally, ensuring data flowed smoothly between views and the `Job` object was tricky, especially during job creation and updates.

The main problem I encountered was with creating the dream job object automatically when a user signs up. Without this object, our app couldn't calculate how well other jobs matched the dream job.

#### Challenges Encountered
1. **Interdependency Errors**: Views relied heavily on each other, causing unexpected issues when making changes.
   
2. **Data Integrity**: Ensuring data moved correctly between views and the `Job` object during job creation and updates was tough.

3. **Logic Flow**: Ensuring views followed a logical order, especially when dealing with user sign-up and dream job creation, required careful planning.

#### Solutions Implemented
1. **Methodical Refactoring**: I carefully reorganized views to reduce their reliance on each other, making the code easier to understand and manage.
   
2. **Improved Error Handling**: I made sure our app handled errors gracefully, giving clear feedback to users when things went wrong.
   
3. **Optimized Data Access**: I worked on improving how our app accesses data, making sure it was efficient and didn't slow things down.
   
4. **Thorough Testing and Validation**: I tested each view extensively to make sure changes didn't cause new problems and everything worked as expected.


### Debugging the Match Percentage Calculation

During the development of my Django application for managing job applications, I encountered an issue with the calculation of the match percentage between the user's job applications and their dream job. The problem was that the match percentage for the dream job was consistently showing as 0% instead of the expected 100%.

To address this issue, I carefully examined the calculate_match_percentage() method in the Job model, which is responsible for calculating the match percentage. After thorough debugging, I identified a logic error in the calculation process.

The root cause of the issue was that the total_percentage variable, which accumulates the match percentage for each field, was being incorrectly incremented inside the loop where it should have been outside. As a result, the match percentage for the dream job was only being calculated for fields where the current job's values differed from the dream job's values, leading to an inaccurate result.

To resolve this issue, I adjusted the logic of the calculate_match_percentage() method to correctly calculate the match percentage for each field and then average them outside the loop. By making this adjustment, I ensured that the match percentage for the dream job is accurately calculated as 100%, indicating a perfect match.

After implementing the fix, the match percentage calculation now works as expected, providing users with accurate insights into how closely their job applications align with their dream job criteria.
